****** OBJECTIVES and SCOPE ******

Recently accompanying the advancement of machine learning especially deep learning, AI-based 
automated medical diagnosis and analysis have come to a new era with exciting progress. It is 
an amazing golden age for the interface researchers involved in the development and applications 
of advanced machine learning techniques to solving medical and clinical problems. This symposium 
aims to capture the most recent important advances in this cross-disciplinary topic and promote 
the interesting topics to wide audience including experts, researchers, students, industry 
developers, medical services, etc..

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

- Medical Image Analysis
- Signal Processing and Medical Imaging
- Deep Learning for Medical Applications
- Automated Medical Diagnostics
- Health and Wellbeing Data Analysis
- Management of Electronic Health Records
- Medical Biometrics
- Medical Robotics
- AIoT Medical Devices
- Brain and Neuroscience
- Mental and Psychological Diagnosis
- Neurodegenerative Diseases
- Cardiac Analysis
- Cancer Diagnosis
- Hermaetology
- Pandemic Prediction and Prevention
- etc.

Established in 2004 by the International Institute for Software
Technology of the United Nations University (UNU-IIST), the ICTAC
conference series aims at bringing together researchers and
practitioners from academia, industry and government to present
research and exchange ideas and experience addressing challenges in
both theoretical aspects of computing and the exploitation of theory
through methods and tools for system development. ICTAC also aims to
promote research cooperation between developing and industrial
countries.

****** SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS ******
We solicit the following types of papers:

Regular papers, with original research contributions;
Short papers, with original work in progress or with proposals of new ideas and emerging challenges;
Survey papers, on summarzing the state of the art research and advances.
The symposium also particularly welcome research papers on post-pandemic medical research and global health and medical management.

Each paper is expected to present a novel research study, a comparative study, or a survey of the literature. 

All submissions should be done via EasyChair:
