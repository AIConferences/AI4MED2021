<p>As part of the design of a space mission, an important part is the design of so-called <em>flight rules</em>. Flight rules express constraints on various parts and processes of the mission, that if followed, will reduce the risk of failure. One such set of flight rules constrain the format of <em>command sequences</em> regularly (e.g. daily) sent to the spacecraft to control its next near term behavior. We present a high-level view of the automated flight rule checker Frc for checking command sequences sent to NASAâ€™s LADEE Lunar mission spacecraft, used throughout its entire mission. A command sequence is in this case essentially a program (a sequence of commands) with no loops or conditionals, and it can there- fore be verified with a trace analysis tool. Frc is implemented using the TraceContract runtime verification tool, an internal Scala DSL for checking event sequences against &ldquo;formal specifications&rdquo;. The paper illustrates this untraditional use of runtime verification in a real con- text, with strong demands on the expressiveness and flexibility of the specification language, illustrating the advantages of an internal DSL.</p>

<p><strong>Klaus Havelund</strong> is a Senior Research Scientist at the Laboratory for Reliable Software (LaRS), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994, partly conducted at Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France. He has worked with formal methods more than 3 decades, and at NASA for more than two decades. His current research interests include runtime verification and development of embedded software systems in high-level programming languages. He is known for his earlier work on the Java PathFinder model checker for
Java, and he was part of the RAISE project (Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering) which developed the RSL wide spectrum specification language. Other work areas include theorem proving and model checking.</p>

<p>With the progress in deductive program verification research, new tools and techniques have become available to reason about non-trivial programs written in widely-used programming languages. However, deductive program verification remains an activity for experts, with ample experience in programming, specification and verification. We would like to change this situation, by developing program verification techniques that are available to a larger audience. Therefore, in this presentation, we show how we developed program verification support for Snap!. Snap! is a visual programming language, aiming in particular at high school students. We support both static and dynamic verification of Snap! programs. Moreover, we also outline how program verification in Snap! could be introduced to high school students in a classroom situation.</p>

<p><strong>Marieke Huisman</strong> is a professor in Software Reliability at the University of Twente, leading the Formal Methods and Tools group. She is well-known for her work on program verification of concurrent software. In 2011, she obtained an ERC Starting Grant, which she used to start development of the VerCors verifier, a tool for the verification of concurrent software. Currently, as part of her NWO personal VICI grant Mercedes, she is working on further improving verification techniques, both by enabling the verification of a larger class of properties, and by making verification more automatic. A main characteristic of the VerCors verifier is that it can reason about different kinds of concurrent programs. In particular, VerCors was originally developed to reason about Java programs, but it can also be used to reason about OpenCL kernels (for GPU), or to prove that compiler directives for parallellisation, such as in OpenMP, are correct.</p>

<p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications that require high assurance guarantees. Verification and understanding of DNNs is hindered by their high complexity, their opaqueness and sensitivity to small adversarial perturbations and also by the lack of high-level formal specifications. In this talk I will describe recent research work which explores techniques and tools to ensure that DNNs and systems that use DNNs are safe, robust and interpretable. Research directions we are pursuing include: symbolic execution for DNN analysis, compositional approaches to improve formal SMT-based verification, property inference for DNNs, adversarial training and detection, and probabilistic reasoning for DNNs. The techniques aim to provide strong guarantees wrt safety and robustness for DNNs, making them amenable for use in safety critical domains, particular autonomy. We have applied our techniques to the analysis of deep neural networks designed to operate as controllers in the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). We have also studied image classification networks (MNIST, CIFAR) and sentiment networks (for text classification).</p>
