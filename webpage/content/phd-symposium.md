### **PhD-iFM'19**\
Welcome to the homepage of PhD-iFM'19, a PhD Symposium at [iFM 2019](/) on
Formal Methods: Algorithms, Tools and Applications, held in
Bergen, Norway on December 3, 2019.

<!--
### *Why to submit?*
-->

Participants will have the possibility to give short presentations
about their research projects.

- The doctoral symposium offers an excellent opportunity to present
  your work in an international setting, and to get feedback from
  senior researchers in the field.
- The doctoral symposium lets you exchange knowledge and experiences
  with fellow PhD-students in a related topic.
- The selected contributions will be published as a technical report
  of the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Norway.


### *Important Dates*

|                   |                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Symposium:        | December 3, 2019           |
| Main Conference: &nbsp;&nbsp; | December 4-6, 2019         |

<!-- Deadlines expire at 23:59 anywhere on earth on the dates displayed
above. 

### *Who can submit?*

PhD students and young researchers at an early career stage (up to 2
years after PhD completion).

### *What to submit?*

You are welcome to submit an extended abstract of 1-3 pages, describing
your research project which you would like to present. Co-authors
are allowed. The results may have been accepted or even published
elsewhere. If you are author of an accepted iFM'19 publication, it is
sufficient to submit the title, authors, and abstract of that paper.

Multiple submissions by one author are not permitted. Submissions
should be written in English and follow the EasyChair formatting
guidelines, available at [http://www.easychair.org/publications/for_authors](http://www.easychair.org/publications/for_authors)

Please submit your abstract electronically in pdf via the following [EasyChair page](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=phdifm19).
  
The submitted abstracts will undergo a lightweight reviewing
process.

### *Invited Speaker*\
Andreas Griesmayer, Senior Research Engineer (Arm, Cambridge, UK)\
\
**Title**: Formal Modelling for Modern CPU Designs\
\
**Abstract**: The Arm architecture describes operation and programming interface of
billions of CPUs produced every year. In addition to smartphones,
chips implementing the Arm architecture power everything from tiny IoT
devices to super computers, with an emphasis on power efficiency.\
Arm maintains and develops the Arm architecture, provides
corresponding compilers, and contributes to operating systems.
Multiple design teams around the globe design compatible CPUs, GPUs
and other essential semiconductor IP.  Instead of building physical
hardware, Arm works with a network of partners that build hardware
based on Arm designs and architectures.  Being at the centre of this
eco systems, it is essential to ensure the integrity of the
architectures and compliance of the designs.  Formal models play an
important role in this process.\
The talk will outline the challenges of formal verification in modern
CPU designs and how formal models capture the expected behaviour of a
processor from the perspective of the architecture, the hardware
implementation, as well as the programmer’s view on the memory model.
It won’t cover details of CPU design, but will highlight challenges,
solutions, and possibly surprising characteristics of modern hardware.
