### **About iFM**

iFM 2019 is concerned with how the application of formal methods may involve modelling different aspects of a system which are best expressed using different formalisms. Correspondingly, different analysis techniques may be used to examine different system views, different kinds of properties, or simply in order to cope with the sheer complexity of the system. The iFM conference series seeks to further research into hybrid approaches to formal modelling and analysis; i.e., the combination of (formal and semi-formal) methods for system development, regarding modelling and analysis, and covering all aspects from language design through verification and analysis techniques to tools and their integration into software engineering practice.

Besides the standard conference track and the Doctoral Symposium, iFM will host a number of workshops and tutorials related to the theme of the conference.  The purpose of the workshops is to provide participants with a friendly, interactive atmosphere for presenting novel ideas and discussing their application.  The goal of the tutorials is to enable the participants to familiarise themselves with theoretical aspects and application of formal methods.

Prospective workshop/tutorial organisers are requested to follow the guidelines below and are encouraged to contact the workshop chairs if any questions arise.

### **Proposal and Submission Guidelines**

Proposals must be written in English, not exceed 5 pages with a reasonable font and margins, and be submitted in PDF format via email to the iFM workshop chairs, Martin Leucker (<leucker@isp.uni-luebeck.de>) and Violet Ka I Pun (<vpu@hvl.no>).

**Workshop** proposals should include:

- The name, the duration (1 or 2 days) and the preferred date of the proposed workshop
- A short description of the workshop.
- If applicable, a description of past versions of the workshop, including dates, organisers, submission and acceptance counts, and attendance.
- The publicity strategy that will be used by the workshop organisers to promote the workshop,
- The participant solicitation and selection process.
- The target audience and expected number of participants.
- Approximate budget proposal (see section Budget below for details).
- The equipment and any other resource necessary for the organisation of the workshop.
- The name and short CV of the organiser(s).
- The publication plan (only invited speakers, no published proceedings, pre-/post-proceedings published with EPTCS/ENTCS/...).

**Tutorial** proposals should include:

- The name, the duration (1/2 or 1 day).
- A short description of the tutorial.
- Motivation for the tutorial (e.g., relation to conference)
- Overview of content, description of the aims, presentation style, potential/preferred prerequisite knowledge.
- Intended audience and expected number of participants.
- List of readings, handbook, tools used in the tutorial.

### **Organisers Responsibilities**

The scientific responsibility of organising a workshop/tutorial is on the workshop/tutorial organisers. In particular, they are responsible for the following items:

- A workshop/tutorial description (200 words) for inclusion in the iFM site.
- Hosting and maintaining web pages to be linked from the iFM site. Workshop/tutorial organisers can integrate their pages into the main iFM pages.
- Scheduling workshop/tutorial activities in collaboration with the iFM workshop chairs. 
- Workshop publicity (possibly including call for papers, submission and review process).
- Workshop proceedings, if any. If there is sufficient interest, the iFM 2019 workshop organisers may contact the editor-in-chief of the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (<http://info.eptcs.org/>) for having a common volume dedicated to the workshops of iFM 2019.

### **Budget**

The iFM organisation will provide registration and organisational support for the workshops and tutorials (including linking from the conferences web sites, set-up of meeting space, on-line and on-site registration). Registration fees must be paid by all participants, including organisers and invited guests.

To cover lunches, coffee breaks and basic organisational expenses, all workshops will be required to charge a minimum participation fee (the precise amount is still to be determined). Each workshop may increase this fee to cover additional expenses such as publication charges, student scholarships, costs for invited speakers, etc. All fees will be collected as part of the iFM registration. 


### **Evaluation Process**

The proposals will be evaluated by the iFM organising committee on the basis of their assessed benefit for prospective participants of iFM 2019. 

### **Venue**

iFM 2019 will take place at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences in Bergen, Norway.  The campus is located around 10 mins by tram from the city centre.

### **Further Information and Enquiries**

You are welcome to contact the iFM workshop chairs Martin Leucker (<leucker@isp.uni-luebeck.de>) and Violet Ka I Pun (<vpu@hvl.no>).
