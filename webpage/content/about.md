Established in 2004 by the International Institute for Software
Technology of the United Nations University (UNU-IIST), the ICTAC
conference series aims at bringing together researchers and
practitioners from academia, industry and government to present
research and exchange ideas and experience addressing challenges in
both theoretical aspects of computing and the exploitation of theory
through methods and tools for system development. ICTAC also aims to
promote research cooperation between developing and industrial
countries.
