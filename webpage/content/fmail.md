### **[International Workshop on Formal Methods and Artificial Intelligence for Logistics](https://fmail.isp.uni-luebeck.de/)**\

Logistics is the process of planning, implementing and controlling procedures for the efficient and effective transportation and storage of goods including services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption for the purpose of conforming to customer requirements. Planning is the process of identifying, scheduling and tracking activities needed to achieve a specific goal, be it in the area of maintenance, production or development. The resulting work plans serve as input and trigger for logistics, and are in turn influenced by it. Logistics 4.0 advocates the universal digitalisation of the whole supply chain to help to automate, verify and coordinate the execution of the procedures among the different stakeholders involved, in nearly real-time, enabling a faster reactivity and resources savings. It includes especially also methods for accounting and contract negotiations between the stakeholders, a field addressed in AI. The workshop is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice for software systems and processes dedicated to logistics and planning. The goal is to provide a symposium for engineers, researchers and business specialists to exchange experiences and problematics in the area. Original research contributions and experience papers on the principles, design, implementation, modelling, analysis, verification, and application of Software or Decision Procedures for logistics systems are solicited.
