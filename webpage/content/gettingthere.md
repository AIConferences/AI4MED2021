From Bergen Airport to Bergen city center:

* The light train (Bybanen) runs from the airport (Bergen Lufthavn Flesland) to the city center (Byparken) and takes around 43 minutes.
  You can buy single- or period-tickets from the ticket machine (works best with credit card), or through the Skyss Ticket app.
* The [airport express bus "Flybussen"](https://www.flybussen.no/en) runs to Bergen center and can be found at the left hand side just outside the main terminal building. The airport bus runs an express route that only takes 20 minutes to the Bergen Bus station (located in the city center).
* Taxi stops are just outside the main terminal building. You may want to consider pre-booking a taxi through one of the apps or the web when you land to get a fixed price guarantee.
* The Zander K hotel can be reached easily by getting off the Bybane at **Nonneseter** (the railway station) and cross through the station.
