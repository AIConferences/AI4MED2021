=== News ===

In addition to long (18 pages) and short (8 pages) papers, iFM this year will accept journal-first papers (4 pages), summarising recently published papers in high-quality journals. See details below.


=== Objectives and scope ===

Applying formal methods may involve the usage of different formalisms
and different analysis techniques to validate a system, either because
individual components are most amenable to one formalism or technique,
because one is interested in different properties of the system, or
simply to cope with the sheer complexity of the system. The iFM
conference series seeks to further research into hybrid approaches to
formal modeling and analysis: the combination of (formal and
semi-formal) methods for system development, regarding both modeling
and analysis. The conference covers all aspects from language design
through verification and analysis techniques to tools and their
integration into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
- Formal and semi-formal modelling notations
- Combining formal methods
- Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice
- Program verification, model checking, and static analysis
- Theorem proving, decision procedures, SAT/SMT solving 
- Runtime analysis, monitoring, and testing
- Program synthesis
- Analysis and synthesis of hybrid, embedded, probabilistic, distributed,
  or concurrent systems
- Abstraction and refinement
- Model learning and inference

=== Submission guidelines ===

iFM 2019 solicits high quality papers reporting research results
and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of formal
method integration.

We accept papers in the following categories:

 (1) Regular papers (limit 18 pages) on
     -  original scientific research results
     -  tools, their foundation and evaluations
     -  applications of formal methods, including rigourous evaluations

 (2) Short papers (limit 8 pages) on
     -  any subject of interest in the area of formal methods that can be
	described with sufficient detail within the page limit

 (3) Journal First papers (limit 4 pages) 
     - summarizing recently published papers in high-quality journals

Page limits include bibliography and any appendices. 

Regular and short papers submitted in categories (1) 
and (2) must be original, unpublished, and not submitted 
for publication elsewhere. Papers in these two categories 
will undergo a thorough review process. Submissions will 
be judged on the basis of significance, relevance,
correctness, originality, and clarity.

The aim of journal-first papers in category (3) is to 
further enrich the program of iFM, as well as to provide 
an overall more flexible path to publication and
dissemination of original research in formal methods. 
The published journal paper must adhere to the following 
four criteria:

    a. It should be clearly within the scope of the 
       conference.

    b. It should be recent: it should have been accepted 
       and made publicly available in a journal (online or 
       in print) by 1 January 2017 or more recently.

    c. It should report new research results that significantly 
       extend prior work -- as opposed as simply extending 
       prior conference work with material such as proofs, 
       algorithms, and minor enhancements.

    d. It has not been presented at, and is not under 
       consideration for, journal-first tracks of other 
       conferences or workshops.

The 4-page submission to iFM for category (3) should provide a 
concise summary of the published journal paper, which makes 
it clear that its topics fits iFM's scope and that a presentation 
of its results would be interesting to the audience of iFM.

Journal-first submissions must be marked as such in the submission’s
title, and must explicitly include full bibliographic details
(including a DOI) of the journal publication they are based on.
Submissions will be judged on the basis of the above criteria, but
also considering how well they would complement the conference's
technical program.

Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2019 Easychair site: 

   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2019

Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style
files.

The conference proceedings will be published in Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A special issue of the
Formal Aspects of Computing - FAOC journal (https://link.springer.com/journal/165)
is planned for extended versions of selected papers from iFM 2019.

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors
must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one
author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the
early registration date, and present the paper.

Springer requires that authors should consult Springer’s authors’guidelines
(ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Guidelines_for_Authors_of_Proceedings.pdf) 
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX 
(ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/llncs2e.zip) or for Word
(ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/word/splnproc1703.zip), 
for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include 
their ORCIDs (https://goo.gl/hbsa4D) in their papers. 
After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author of each paper, acting 
on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a 
Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright 
form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once 
the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship 
of the papers cannot be made.
